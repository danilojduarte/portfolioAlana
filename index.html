            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <h2>Design has
                been my passion since I was barely old enough to sharpen my own pencils.</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Natal City, Brazil native and love the beauty of my home city. As a child I spent most of my time
                drawing and creating works of art. That passion has carried through my life in so many ways.</p>
            <p>
                My passion turned into a career focus as I began winning design contests on the competitive site
                99Designs. I began designing as full time freelancer in 2012 and now I have a wide range of experience
                with clients from all over the world including Canada and the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hard work and creativity has served me well and I have been busy freelancing ever since. I currently
                work as a partner at WellPut Custom Content and Design and continue to freelance for clients locally and
                internationally.
